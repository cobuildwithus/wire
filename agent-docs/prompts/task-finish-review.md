description: Final completion audit, including coverage and proof review, for correctness and compatibility
action: thorough review
---

You are performing a final audit of completed changes. Use full diff/context and inspect all modified files plus directly affected call paths.

Runtime expectation:
- This audit may take 5 to 10 minutes on a non-trivial diff.
- Work methodically instead of rushing to a shallow answer.
- Parent agent: allow the run to continue and do not cancel it early unless there is clear evidence the audit is stuck or off scope.

Coverage/proof responsibility:
- This final audit replaces any standalone `test-coverage-audit` pass.
- Inspect modified production files and nearby tests to decide whether the change has direct proof at the highest stable behavior boundary available.
- If meaningful proof is missing, recommend the smallest high-impact tests or direct scenario checks needed to close the gap.

Preflight (required):
- Read `agent-docs/exec-plans/active/COORDINATION_LEDGER.md` before review.
- Honor any explicit exclusive/refactor notes from the ledger; otherwise work carefully on top of active rows without reverting adjacent edits.

Review for:
- functional and behavioral regressions
- edge cases and failure-mode handling
- incorrect assumptions and invariant breaks
- compatibility and correctness risks
- unexpected interface or state-transition changes
- coverage and test gaps for newly introduced risk or modified behavior
- unnecessary complexity, speculative abstractions, or diff size that is disproportionate to the task
- missed reuse or duplicated logic that likely came from incomplete codebase recall
- verification gaps where passing checks still do not prove the changed behavior at a real boundary
- proof gaps where verification stays inside helpers, mocks, or snapshots and never exercises the highest stable boundary available

Output requirements:
- Return findings ordered by severity (`high`, `medium`, `low`).
- For each finding include: `severity`, `file:line`, `issue`, `impact`, `recommended fix`.
- Include `Open questions / assumptions` when uncertainty remains.
- If no findings exist, state that explicitly and list residual risk areas, including any direct-scenario verification still left to human checking.
